If you're reading this then thanks - be ready for a whole load of NFL chat mixed with tech and sprinkles of data!

You may see the occasional travel write-up, my girlfriend and I spend most of our annual leave exploring new countries. üåè 
Though, given what's happening now we won't be going anywhere, anytime soon..

So, a little bit about me - I currently work in the technology team at a trading software company based in London and absolutely love it. 

I gained a huge amount of experience working at a sports tech start-up. It doesn't matter what anyone says, sports data is the most interesting and maybe weather data too.

Onto the blog then. Strangely, for something like this you're spoilt for choice - should you use [dev](https://dev.to/), [medium](https://medium.com/) or [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/).
Maybe make your own static pages with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Too many options right?!

I've opted for the [gatsby-starter-minimal-blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) and found it easy to implement and who doesn't love markdown.
