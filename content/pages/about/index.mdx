Hi!👋 Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working in commodities trading with some of the smartest and talented Software Engineers 🧮

Previously, I gained experience at a tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams and organisations around the world ⚽🏈🏀🏉🎾🏏🏃‍♂️🧑‍🚀

I love learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend most of my time exploring new tools, technologies and frameworks. I write in Python, C#, SQL and love using Docker 🐳

Other than writing code, I follow the NFL and spend my Sunday's supporting the Dallas Cowboys! ✭
