If you're reading this then thanks, be ready for a whole load of NFL chat mixed with tech and sprinkles of data!

My girlfriend and I spend most of our annual leave exploring new countries. üåè Though, given what's happening now we won't be going anywhere, anytime soon..

I currently work in the technology team at a trading software company and absolutely love it. Before that, I was working 
at a sports tech start-up. It doesn't matter what anyone says, sports data is the most interesting and maybe weather data too.

Strangely, for something like this you're spoilt for choice - should you use [dev](https://dev.to/), [medium](https://medium.com/) or [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). 
Maybe make your own static pages with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Too many options!

I've opted for the [gatsby-starter-minimal-blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) and found it easy to implement for my use case.
