  Hello, I'm Pratik 👋
</Text>

Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working in asset management, building APIs 
and managing tech infrastructure used by teams around the globe. 🌎 I work in C#, run everything 
in Kubernetes and always look to find ways of automating anything and everything.

Prior to that I was building distributed systems in the energy trading sector, working with some 
of the smartest and talented Software Engineers and Product Managers 🖥️ I got into tech and to 
where I am now through my experience at a tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams and 
organisations around the world; from the NBA, NFL, Premier League and NCAA Football 🏀🏈⚽🏃 and even 
astronauts 🧑‍🚀 I presented a Case Study at the Gartner Data and Analytics Summit London - "What Tim 
Peake has for Breakfast and other Stories from the Frontier of Human Performance Analytics."

I enjoy learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend most of my time exploring new tools, technologies and 
frameworks. I predominantly write in C#, T-SQL and can't imagine not using Docker 🐳 and Kubernetes ☸

Other than writing code, I have a passion for travelling! My girlfriend and I are always booking 
last-minute flights away. ✈️ I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend my Sunday's supporting the 
Dallas Cowboys! ✭
