  Hi. 👋

Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working for a trading software company with some of 
the smartest and talented Software Engineers 🖥️

Previously, I gained experience at a tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams and organisations 
around the world; from the NBA, NFL, Premier League and NCAA Football 🏀🏈⚽🏃‍ and even astronauts 🧑‍🚀

I love learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend most of my time exploring new tools, technologies and frameworks. 
I predominantly write in C#, T-SQL, (some) Python/R and love using Docker 🐳

Other than writing code, I love travelling! My girlfriend and I are always booking last-minute flights away. ✈️

I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend my Sunday's supporting the Dallas Cowboys! ✭
