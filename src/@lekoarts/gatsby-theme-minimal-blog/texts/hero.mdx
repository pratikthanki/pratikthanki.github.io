  Hi. 👋
</Text>

Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working for a software trading company with some of 
the smartest and talented Software Engineers and Product Managers 🖥️

Previously, I gained experience at a tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams and organisations 
around the world; from the NBA, NFL, Premier League and NCAA Football 🏀🏈⚽🏃‍ and even astronauts 🧑‍🚀 I 
presented a Case Study at the Gartner Data and Analytics Summit London - "What Tim Peake has for Breakfast 
and other Stories from the Frontier of Human Performance Analytics."

I love learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend most of my time exploring new tools, technologies and frameworks. 
I predominantly write in C#, T-SQL, (some) Python/R and love using Docker 🐳 I've been getting into Kafka, 
Kotlin and Kubernetes.

Other than writing code, I love travelling! My girlfriend and I are always booking last-minute flights away. ✈️ 
I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend my Sunday's supporting the Dallas Cowboys! ✭
