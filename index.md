## Hello! üëã

Thanks for stopping by. My name is Pratik, I'm a software engineer working in asset management 
leading the design of scalable and performant applications and tech infrastructure used by 
teams around the globe for real-time decisions making.

The tech stack is C#/.NET, runs in containers and deployed/managed through Kubernetes. 
Everything is automated with sound CI/CD pipelines.

Previosuly, I was building distributed systems in the energy trading sector, working with some 
of the smartest and talented Software Engineers and Product Managers. Before that, I was at a 
sports tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams and organisations around the world; 
from the NBA, NFL, Premier League and NCAA Football and even astronauts.

I presented a Case Study at the Gartner Data and Analytics Summit London - "What Tim Peake has 
for Breakfast and other Stories from the Frontier of Human Performance Analytics."

Other than writing code, I have a passion for travelling! My girlfriend and I are always booking 
last-minute flights away. ‚úàÔ∏è I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend my Sunday's watching Red
