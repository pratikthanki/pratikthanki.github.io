## Hello! 👋

Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working in asset management 
leading the design of scalable and performant applications and tech infrastructure 
used by teams around the globe for real-time decisions making. 🌎 I work in C#, run 
everything in containers 🐳 and deploy/manage event-driven architectures on 
Kubernetes ☸ and look to automate anything and everything.

Previosuly, I was building distributed systems in the energy trading sector, working 
with some of the smartest and talented Software Engineers and Product Managers 🖥️ 
Before that, I was at a sports tech start-up working with the biggest sports teams 
and organisations around the world; from the NBA, NFL, Premier League and NCAA Football 
🏀🏈⚽🏃 and even astronauts 🧑‍🚀 I presented a Case Study at the Gartner Data and Analytics 
Summit London - "What Tim Peake has for Breakfast and other Stories from the Frontier 
of Human Performance Analytics."

### Interests

I enjoy learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend my time exploring new tools, technologies 
and frameworks. I am currently learning Go and gRPC ⚡

Other than writing code, I have a passion for travelling! My girlfriend and I are 
always booking last-minute flights away. ✈️ I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend 
my Sunday's supporting the Dallas Cowboys! ✭

This is my featured piece on observability for the Grafana Blog on how I leverage 
Grafana Cloud for my NFL play-by-play API: [How the FourthDown NFL play-by-play API measures its performance with Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/02/05/how-the-fourthdown-nfl-play-by-play-api-measures-its-performance-with-prometheus-jaeger-and-grafana-cloud/)
