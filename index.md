## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. My name is Pratik, I'm a software engineer working in investment 
management working on the quant investment platform. The tech stack is C#/.NET and Python, 
runs on container-based managed services on AWS. Everything is automated with sound CI/CD 
pipelines.

### About me

I have a varied background in technology, from building and scaling data platforms used by 
quants and analysts for equity, fixed-income and alternatives research, through to building 
low-latency distributed systems in the energy trading sector, where the expectation is high 
availability. I even worked at a sports tech start-up building bespoke applications, working 
with some of the biggest sports teams and organisations around the world, including: the New 
York Knicks, Boston Celtics, New England Patriots, Arsenal FC and even the European Space 
Agency.

I presented a Case Study at the Gartner Data and Analytics Summit London - "What Tim Peake 
has for Breakfast and other Stories from the Frontier of Human Performance Analytics."

If you found any of what I have already said intriguing, you can read more about about my 
[experience](./experience).

### Interests

I enjoy learning. Outside of work I spend my alot of time exploring new tools, technologies
and frameworks. I am currently learning - Go and Service Mesh and exploring Apach Samza.

Other than writing code, I have a passion for travelling. My girlfriend and I are always 
booking last-minute flights away. I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend my Sunday's 
watching Red Zone.
