Thanks for stopping by - I'm a curious problem solver working in asset management, 
building APIs and managing tech infrastructure used by teams around the globe to 
make real-time decisions. 🌎 I work in C#, run everything in Docker containers 🐳 
and deploy/manage architecture on Kubernetes ☸ and always look to find ways of 
automating anything and everything.

Prior to that I was building distributed systems in the energy trading sector, working 
with some of the smartest and talented Software Engineers and Product Managers 🖥️ I got 
into tech and to where I am now through my experience at a tech start-up working with 
the biggest sports teams and organisations around the world; from the NBA, NFL, Premier 
League and NCAA Football 🏀🏈⚽🏃 and even astronauts 🧑‍🚀 I presented a Case Study at the 
Gartner Data and Analytics Summit London - "What Tim Peake has for Breakfast and other 
Stories from the Frontier of Human Performance Analytics."

I enjoy learning 🤟 Outside of work I spend most of my time exploring new tools, 
technologies and frameworks. I am currently learning Go and gRPC ⚡

Other than writing code, I have a passion for travelling! My girlfriend and I are 
always booking last-minute flights away. ✈️ I also follow (and love) the NFL and spend 
my Sunday's supporting the Dallas Cowboys! ✭

I like to write about various aspects of technology and computer science, read my 
posts [**here**](./posts.html).
